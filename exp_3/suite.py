"""Experiment 3: Selection comparison for two groups.

An initial embedding is inferred using real observations data. This
embedding is then treated as ground truth for the purpose of simulating
human behavior for two different display configurations.

Notes:
    For simiplicity, the dimensionality is not inferred at each step.
        Instead, the correct dimensionality is provided.
    Perform multiple runs.
