Understanding instabilities

R^2 value does not assymptote smoothly.

Optimizer:
    Adam maybe slightly worse because it is so aggressive.

Single sample versus multiple sample trials:
    may help, still unclear

gamma=0 for ground truth
    possible that a ground truth value of gamma=0 causes special issues

Regularizer?

Different measures?

instabilities with low number of stimuli for 2c1?

Below approximately 25 stimuli, comparison scores become unstable because
small changes result in large differences in scores. More generally, a small
number of stimuli provides fewer constraints and thus more flexibility in
solutions.
