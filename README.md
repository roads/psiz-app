# psiz-brm
## Obtaining psychological embeddings through joint kernel and metric learning

This repository can be used to reproduce the results in Roads & Mozer (in press).

## Software requirements
You will need a Python interpretter (>= 3.6) along with the an installation of the psiz package (version 0.1.0) in your preferred environment. You can install the correct version of the psiz package using pip: `pip install psiz==0.1.0`. You can also find version 0.1.0 on GitHub: https://github.com/roads/psiz/archive/v0.1.0.tar.gz.

Once you have the psiz package installed, you can run the script `experiment_suite.py`. Note that this script is computationally expensive and will typically take a few weeks to finish.
